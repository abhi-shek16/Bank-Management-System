# 🏦 Bank Management System

## 💡 Description

Developed a command-line based banking system using C++ that simulates real-world financial operations for both **Savings** and **Current** accounts. Implemented core Object-Oriented Programming concepts including **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction** to create modular account types.

Utilized **STL containers** like `map` and `vector` for efficient account management. Optional support for **file handling** allows persistent data storage. Features include:

- Interest calculation for Savings accounts
- Overdraft protection for Current accounts
- Complete transaction history logging

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- STL (`map`, `vector`)
- File Handling (optional)
- Operating System Concepts (for file/IO control)

## 🚀 Features

- Create and manage multiple user accounts
- Account type: Savings and Current
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Interest calculation logic
- Overdraft protection
- Unique account ID tracking using `map`
- View transaction history (optional: via file handling)

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run
